# Commentary
For this project, I created a small web-based game where the player must avoid objects falling from the sky. The core idea was to make something fast, simple, and fun while also learning how to export a C++/Raylib game to the web using Emscripten. Although the game mechanics were straightforward, most of the development time ended up being spent dealing with build issues and the web-export pipeline.

The gameplay itself is simple: the player controls a character that can move left and right while objects fall from above at increasing speed. The main challenge was making the movement and collision feel responsive. Raylib made this easier because it provides simple functions for drawing shapes, checking collisions, and handling input. The falling objects are stored in a small array, and each one updates its position every frame, resetting when it falls off the screen. Even though the mechanics are basic, I still had to tweak the spawn rate and fall speed to get the right level of difficulty.

The most difficult part of the project was integrating Emscripten so the game could run in a browser. Setting up the environment took much longer than expected. One of the biggest problems was making sure the correct Emscripten version was active and that the compiler could find Raylib’s include and library paths. I also had issues with the build command not detecting my source files, which turned out to be caused by running the terminal in the wrong directory. These small mistakes slowed down progress but taught me how important folder structure and build paths are when exporting to the web.

I also planned to connect an online API that would display an inspirational quote when the player lost the game. This required using Emscripten’s networking features, but I ran into problems because the fetch API wasn’t working the way I expected. I had trouble enabling the right flags, and the browser kept blocking the request due to CORS issues. Eventually I decided to leave the feature out for now, but the attempt taught me a lot about how browser security works and how different web builds are compared to desktop builds. If I return to the project later, I will probably re-implement the feature using Emscripten’s emscripten_fetch system or by creating a tiny proxy server.

In the end, even though the project looks simple, it forced me to learn a lot of technical skills: handling collisions, tuning gameplay, troubleshooting compiler errors, working with Emscripten, and dealing with web limitations. I also learned the importance of testing frequently, reading compiler output carefully, and breaking problems into smaller steps. While I wasn’t able to finish every feature I planned, the project helped me understand the full pipeline from C++ code to browser-ready HTML/JS output, which will be useful in future game development work.
